INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR gfmviewer-wx
=============================================================================

The build process has been tested on OS X 10.8.4 and a variety of Linux
installs (including Raspbian/Wheezy). It requires a modern version of Python
2.x and wxPython 2.8 (stable) or 2.9 (development). Any Unix-like environment
should work. Technically a `standard' installation of Python/wxPython on
Windows should also work; however this has not been tested.


Installing the package on a Unix-like system
------------------------------------------

The package depends on wxPython 2.8/2.9; so ensure that one of these is
installed. The library can be downloaded using a package manager or from the
original web page:

    http://www.wxpython.org/download.php

The gfmviewer script itself is pure Python and so only requires installing.
The usual distutils options are available (e.g. --prefix if you don't want
the script installed in the standard location). More details can be found
using:

    $ python ./setup.py --help

To perform a standard install (assuming root permission is required):

    $ sudo python ./setup.py install

Once installed it should be possible to start the script from the command-line
using:

    $ gfmviewer

See the README file for further.
